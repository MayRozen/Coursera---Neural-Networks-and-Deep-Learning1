# Neural Networks and Deep Learning

I decided to take the 'Deep Learning' course on Coursera due to my strong interest in this field. My degree research focuses on deep learning because I find it both fascinating and impactful. I chose to study this subject independently to develop the skills and tools needed to conduct research in a field that truly captivates me.
Additionally, I find deep learning to be a highly important field, with applications across various domains such as image and audio recognition, among others. It is a powerful and essential tool in the broader areas of machine learning and AI.
This course provided me with a more precise perspective on machine learning and clarified how many processes are calculated and performed behind the scenes.
